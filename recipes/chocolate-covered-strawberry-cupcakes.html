        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners. 
                    This recipe yields about 15 cupcakes, so line a second muffin pan with 3 cupcake 
                    liners or bake in batches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make the cupcakes: Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, 
                    and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside. Whisk the oil, sugar, egg, vanilla, 
                    and buttermilk together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry 
                    ingredients, add the hot coffee/water, and whisk until the batter is completely 
                    combined. Batter is thin.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour/spoon the batter into the liners, filling only 2/3 full to avoid spilling 
                    over the sides. You should have enough batter for 15 cupcakes. Bake for 20&ndash;22 minutes, 
                    or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool 
                    completely. Cupcakes must be completely cooled—and even chilled for 20&ndash;30 
                    minutes in the refrigerator if they&apos;re particularly sticky on top—before assembling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make the chocolate ganache: Place finely chopped chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. 
                    Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to gently simmer. 
                    (Do not let it come to a rapid boil—that&apos;s too hot!) Pour over chocolate, 
                    then let it sit for 2&ndash;3 minutes to gently soften the chocolate. With a metal 
                    spoon or small rubber spatula, very slowly stir until chocolate has melted and mixture 
                    is smooth. Ganache is thin. The finer you chopped the chocolate, the quicker it will melt 
                    with the cream. If it&apos;s not melting, do not microwave it. Once ganache mixture 
                    is smooth, transfer it to the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 
                    30 minutes to thicken before spreading on cooled and filled cupcakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make the strawberry buttercream filling: As the ganache cools and thickens, 
                    make the filling. Using a blender or food processor, process the freeze-dried 
                    strawberries into a powdery crumb. You should have around 1/4 cup. Set aside. 
                    In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment,
                    beat the butter on medium-high speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sifted confectioners&apos; 
                    sugar, strawberry powder, heavy cream, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, 
                    then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Taste. Add a pinch of salt if frosting 
                    is too sweet. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fill the cupcakes: Using a sharp knife, cut a circle into the center of the 
                    cooled cupcakes to create a little pocket about 1 inch deep. The piece you removed 
                    will be sort of cone-shaped. Spoon or pipe strawberry buttercream inside each 
                    carved-out cupcake—use however much frosting will fit. (I use either a teaspoon 
                    measuring spoon or Wilton piping tip #12 to fill cupcakes. Usually you can fit between 1&ndash;2 
                    teaspoons of frosting in each.) Slice/tear off the pointy end of the “cone” piece of cupcake 
                    you removed, and gently press the round piece back on top of the filling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Top with ganache: With a knife or small icing spatula, spread the thickened 
                    chocolate ganache on top of each cupcake. Spread on a thick layer, so it sets 
                    as a thick fudge-like topping. Garnish with fresh strawberry slices or sprinkles, 
                    if desired.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve immediately or store covered at room temperature or in the refrigerator 
                    for up to 1 day before serving. Cover and store leftover cupcakes in the refrigerator 
                    for up to 5 days. I recommend a cupcake carrier for storing and transporting decorated cupcakes.
