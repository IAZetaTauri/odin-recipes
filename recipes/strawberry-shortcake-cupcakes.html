            Instructions
        </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make the strawberry filling first: Using a fork, mix the cornstarch and water together in a 
                    small bowl until the cornstarch has dissolved—mixture is thick. Warm the strawberries and sugar together 
                    in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir the mixture as it cooks, and break up some of the strawberries 
                    as you stir. Bring it to a simmer. Once simmering, stir in the cornstarch mixture. Allow to simmer for 5 
                    minutes, stirring constantly. After 5 minutes, remove from heat, stir in the lemon zest, and cool completely. 
                    Mixture thickens as it cools. (It must completely cool, so transferring to a bowl out of the saucepan helps 
                    speed that up, as does refrigerating it. You can complete a few other steps in the recipe as the mixture cools.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 12&ndash;cup muffin pan with cupcake liners. This recipe 
                    yields about 15 cupcakes, so line a second muffin pan with 3 cupcake liners, or bake in batches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside. In a medium bowl, 
                    whisk the melted butter and sugar together. Mixture will be gritty. Whisk in the egg whites, sour cream, milk, 
                    and vanilla bean paste/extract until combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until the batter is completely combined. Batter should 
                    be creamy and mostly smooth; a few small lumps are OK.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour/spoon the batter into the liners, filling only 2/3 full to avoid spilling over the sides. You should have enough batter for 15 cupcakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake for 20&ndash;22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove cupcakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. 
                    Cupcakes must be completely cooled before filling and topping.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fill the cupcakes: First, set aside 1/2 cup of the filling for the whipped cream topping. Using a sharp knife, 
                    cut a circle into the center of the cooled cupcakes to create a little pocket about 1 inch deep. The piece 
                    you removed will be sort of cone-shaped. Spoon some of the cooled and thickened strawberry filling inside 
                    each carved-out cupcake—use however much will fit. (I use a teaspoon for this. Usually you can fit between 1&ndash;2 teaspoons
                    of filling in each.) Slice/tear off the pointy end of the “cone” piece of cupcake you removed, and gently press the round 
                    piece back on top of the filling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make the whipped cream: Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, 
                    sugar, and vanilla bean paste/extract on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3&ndash;4 minutes. Medium 
                    peaks are between soft/loose peaks and stiff peaks, and are the perfect consistency for topping and piping on desserts. 
                    If you accidentally over-whip the cream, and it looks curdled and heavy, pour in a little bit more cold heavy cream, 
                    and fold it in gently by hand with a spatula until it smooths out. Fold in the reserved 1/2 cup of strawberry filling. 
                    Use immediately or cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Frost cooled cupcakes.
                    You may have some leftover if you don&apos;t use as much on each cupcake. 
                    Garnish cupcakes with sliced strawberries and/or fresh mint.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Cover and store leftover cupcakes in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
